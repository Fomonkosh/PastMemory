# Past Memory

**Past Memory** is a simple desktop application for saving, organizing, and searching useful links.

In the modern digital world, we constantly encounter valuable content — articles, videos, tutorials, documentation — often at moments when we don’t have the time or motivation to explore it immediately.  
Past Memory helps you **store these links with categories and short descriptions**, so you can return to them later in a structured way.

## Features

### Input – Add new links
On the **Input** tab, you can:

- Search links by **category**
- Search links by **description**
- Combine category and description for more precise results
- Leave one of the fields empty to search only by the other

Search results are displayed in a table with the following columns:
- URL
- Category

### Settings
The **Settings** tab is reserved for future functionality.

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally** on the user’s computer.

- Categories and links are persisted between application runs
- No external database or internet connection is required
- Data is stored in the user’s home directory

This makes the application lightweight, fast, and independent.
